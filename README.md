# Event Manager

Event manager is a web application for creating and attending events.\
Users can make accounts, and with a time and place in mind, they can create \
an event which is open to the public. If you just feel like attending an event \
you can search and find nearby events, see who's hosting or who else is attending \
the event, and choose to attend if you want to.

## Getting started

This project uses ReactJS for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. \
The code is split in the backend and frontend folders. \
To get the frontend setup, you will need to download ReactJS and run `npm install` \
in the frontend directory. Run `npm start` to start the frontend. It will be hosted on \
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To get the backend setup, you will need to download Ruby and the Rails framework.\
Run `gem install drip` in the backend directory to install dependencies, and run rake db:create \
to create the database. Run `rails s` to start the backend server. It will be hosted on \
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Motivations

The main motivations in creating this app was to learn new technology stacks, mainly \
web development stacks, in ReactJS and Rails, and learn how to integrate API's, google-maps. \
Throughout the process of the backend development, I became really ingrained with the MVC concept and \
implementation, more comfortable with setting up SQL databases, routing, and juggling between \
prod/development/test environments.
Throughout the process of the frontend development, I became very comfortable with React and \
the entire component framework(props and hooks), and using async calls.
